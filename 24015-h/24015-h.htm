April Fool, who likes a bit of sport above measure, &amp; had some
pretensions to the lady besides as being but a cousin once
removed,&mdash;clapped &amp; halloo&#8217;d them on; and as fast as their indignation
cooled those mad wag&#8217;s, the Ember Days, were at it with their bellows, to
blow it into a flame; &amp; all was in a ferment: till old Madame Septuagesima

tale of the lovers which she could reckon
when she was young; &amp; of one Master Rogation Day in particular, who was
for ever putting the question to her; but she kept him at a distance, as
the chronicle wd: tell&mdash;by which I apprehend she meant the Almanack.</p>

the Days before the Flood&mdash;which plainly showed her old head to be little
better than crazed &amp; doited.</p>

<p class="vrs">Lord Mayor&#8217;s Day went off in a mist as usual; Shortest Day in a deep black
Fog that wrapt the little gentleman all round like a hedgehog. Two
Vigils&mdash;so watchmen are called in heaven&mdash;saw Christmas Day safe

sturdy patrole, called the Eve of St. Christopher&mdash;</p>

together in one of the prettiest silvery twilights a Lover&#8217;s Day could
